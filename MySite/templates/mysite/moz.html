                <p>We were inspired in the year 2013 to purchase a Zion City of Prayer. We prayerfully acted on this
                    divine prompting, mobilizing human and material resources available to procure a landed property to
                    build the city. A search party was raised and a place was secured at Akinwaare Village. The village
                    is located Off Ido-Eruwa road in Ido Local Government Area of Oyo State.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purchasing sum was transferred to Baba Baale Akinwaare's bank account as the total sum for the
                    procurement of the 8 acres of land. Land Agreement document was prepared by Barrister Babatolu, and
                    he also supervised the signing of the document. The survey plan was given to a competent surveyor
                    and red copy must be provided to indicate official approval of the state government. Video coverage
                    was done to record every stage of the procurement.
